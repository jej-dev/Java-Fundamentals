# 1.3 Comments and Whitespace
## Comments
A ***comment*** is text a programmer adds to code, to be read by humans to better understand the code but ignored by the compiler. Two common kinds of comments exist:
- A ***single-line comment*** starts with // and includes all the following text on that line. Single-line comments commonly appear after a statement on the same line.
- A ***multi-line comment*** starts with /* and ends with */, where all text between /* and */ is part of the comment. A multi-line comment is also known as ***block comment***.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

/*
This program calculates the amount of pasta to cook, given the number of people eating.

Author: J
Date:   XX-XX-XXXX

*/

public class PastaCalculator {
    public static void main (String [] args) {
        Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
        int numPeople;  //Number of people that will be eating.
        int totalOuncesPasta; //Total ounces of pasta to serve numPeople.

        //Get number of people.
        System.out.println("Enter number of people: ");
        numPeople = scnr.nextInt();

        // Calculate and print total ounces of pasta
        totalOuncesPasta = numPeople * 3; // Typical ounces per person.
        System.out.println("Cook" + totalOuncesPasta + "ounces of pasta.");
    }
}

```

## Whitespace
***Whitespace*** refers to blank spaces (space and tab characters) between items within a statement and blank lines between statements (called newlines). A compiler ignores most whitespace.

*Good practice is to deliberately and consistently use whitespace to make a program more readable.* Programmers usually follow conventions defined by their company, team, instructor, etc., such as:
- Use blank lines to seperate conceptually distinct statements.
- Indent lines the same amount.
- Align items to reduce visual clutter.
- Use a single space before and after any operators like =,+,* or / to make statements more readable.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class WhitespaceEx{
    public static void main (String [] args) {
        Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
        int myFirstVar;             //Aligned comments yield less
        int yetAnotherVar;          //visual clutter
        int thirdVar;

        //Above blank line separates variable declarations from the rest of the program.
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        myFirstVar = scnr.nextInt();

        //Above blank line separates user input statements from the rest.
        yetAnotherVar = myFirstVar; //Aligned = operators.
        thirdVar = yetAnotherVar + 1;
        //Also notice the single-space on left and right of + and =
        // (except when aligning the second = with the first =)

        System.out.println(("Final value is ") + thirdVar); //Single-space on each side of + 
    }
}
```

## Compiling code with comments and whitespace
Comments do not generate machine code. Therefore, when compiling code with comments and whitespaces the steps taken are as follows:
1. The compiler convers a high level program into an executable program using Java bytecode.
2. Comments do not generate machine code.
3. the compiler recognizes end of statement by semicolon ";".
