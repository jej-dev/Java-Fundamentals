# 1.2 Programming basics
## A first program
A simple Java program appears below:
- A ***program*** starts in main(), executing the statements within main's braces{}, one at a time.
- Each statement typically appears alone on a line and ends with a ***semicolon***, as English sentences end with a period.
- The ```int wage``` statement creates an integer variable named wage. The ```wage = 20``` statement assigns wage with 20.
- The print and println statements output various values.

```java
public class Salary(
    public static void main (String [] args) {
        int wage;

        wage = 20;

        System.out.print("Salary is ");
        System.out.println(wage * 40 * 52);
    }
)
```

## Basic Input
Programs commonly get input values, perform some processing on that input, and put output values to a screen or elsewhere. Input is commonly gotten from a keyboard, a file, fields on a web form or app, etc.

The following code at the top of a file enables the program to get input:
```import java.util.Scanner;```

A ***Scanner*** is a text parser that can get numbers, words, or phrases from an input source such as the keyboard. Getting input is achieved by first creating a Scanner object via the statement:
```Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);```
```System.in``` corresponds to keyboard input. Then, given ```Scanner``` object ```scnr```, the following statement gets an input value and assigns ```x``` with that value:
```x = scnr.nextInt();```

## Basic output: Text
The ***System.out.print*** construct supports output. Outputting text is achieved via:
```System.out.print("desired text");```
Text in double quotes "" is known as a ***string literal***. Multiple output stements continue printing on the same output line.

```System.out.println``` (note the ``ln`` at the end, short for "line"), starts a new output line after the outputted values, called a ***newline***.

*A common error is to type the number "1" or a capital I, as in "in", instead of a lower case ```l``` as in "print line"*.

## Outputting text and new lines.

```java
public class KeepCalm {
    public static void main (String [] args) {
        System.out.print("Keep calm");
        System.out.print("and");
        System.out.print("carry on");
    }
}


Output:
Keep calmandcarry on
```

```java
public class KeepCalm {
    public static void main (String [] args) {
        System.out.println("Keep calm");
        System.out.println("and");
        System.out.println("carry on");
    }
}


Output:
Keep calm
and
carry on
```

## Outputting a variable's value
Outputting a variable's value is achieved via:
```System.out.print(x);```

> Note that no quotes surround ```x```. ```println()``` could also be used.

```java
public class Salary {
    public static void main (String [] args) {
        int wage;
        wage = 20;
        System.out.print("Wage is: ");
        System.out.println(wage);
        System.out.println("Goodbye.");
    }
}

Output:
Wage is: 20
Goodbye.

```

Note that the programmer intentionally did *not* start a new output line after outputting "Wage is: " so that the wage variable's value would appear on that same line.

## Outputting multiple items with one statement
Programmers commonly use a single output statement for each line of output by combining the outputting of text, variable values, and a new line. The programmer simply separates the items with a ```+``` symbol. Such combining can improve program readability because the program's code corresponds more closely to the program's output.

```java
public class Salary {
    public static void main (String [] args) {
        int wage;
        wage = 20;
        System.out.println("Wage is: " + wage);
        System.out.println("Goodbye.");
    }
}

Output:
Wage is: 20
Goodbye.
```

> A new output line can also be produced by inserting ```\n```, known as a ***newline character***, within a *string literal*.
>Ex: Outputting "1\n2\n3" outputs each number on its own output line. ```\n``` consists of two characters, ```\``` and ```n```, but together are considered as one newline character. Good practice is to use println to output a newline when possible, as println has some technical advantages not mentioned here.
